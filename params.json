(åäøé ãâîà)\r\n\r\nLicense: WTFPLv2, see COPYING for the full license text.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou can fire up the program with no arguments if you only need to re-encode Windows-1252 (Western European) as Windows-1255 (Hebrew, Logical). It'll prompt you for a line of text, and will demystify each one once you enter a carriage-return or similar.\r\n\r\nThere also exists the `--mac-archive` option which, when passed to the program, makes it demystify lines of text by re-encoding Mac-Roman into CP-856 instead. Apparently, OSX sometimes has trouble with archives containing Hebrew characters in filenames, and this is the way to demystify them.\r\n\r\nThere should be a `--help` option, optionally shorthanded as `-h` with a basic help and usage screen, too.\r\n\r\nThe Fine Print™\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n* Only use Python >= 3\r\n* Can only demystify one line at a time, because I'm lazy\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
